# Account Generator

Here is a [demo](https://i.imgur.com/eEcF5R0.mp4)

## Update March 15th 2020

Looks like the gen is now working once again just fine! If you encounter any issues, read through this file and if you don't find an anwser, feel free to message me on Discord (rtuna#4321). Follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/rtunazzz)) if you want to know whenever an update is out!

**Use of proxies is NECESSARY.**


## Before running

1. Make sure you have Python (preferably 3.8.0) installed
2. download & unzip this the zip you donwloaded, open your CMD/Terminal and `cd` to this folder.
3. run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Add your info into `userdata.json`
5. Add proxies into `proxies.txt`
6. Feel free to turn on/off any "jigging" in the `userdata.json` but **for some reason if you set `jig_first_line` to false, you'll run into errors and most likely won't be able to generate any accounts. Feel free to try it though!**

## To run

open your terminal, change your directory to this folder/repo and run:

- on Mac: `python3 main.py`

- on Widnows: `py main.py`

## Common errors

1. The script closes itself after you input the number of accounts you want to generate? YOU DIDN'T FOLLOW THE INSTURCTIONS AND YOU'RE RUNNING IT THE WRONG WAY, FOLLOW [THESE STEPS](https://github.com/rtunaboss/SoleboxAccountGenerator#before-running)
2. `[FATAL ERROR] -> "Some dependencies are not installed."` = you don't have any of the dependencies installed. Make sure you did everything in [Before running](https://github.com/rtunaboss/SoleboxAccountGenerator#before-running). If that doesn't fix it, try running:
     - on Windows `py -m pip install -r requirements.txt`
     - on Mac `python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt`

3. `'pip' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file.` or anything related to this -> either you don't have Python in Path (`setx PATH "%PATH%;C:\Python38\Scripts"` - ONLY IF YOU'RE ON WINDOWS). If that doesn't help, try running:
     - on Windows `py -m pip install -r requirements.txt`
     - on Mac `python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. I keep getting `keyerror firstname` = you replaced something you weren't supposed to replace in the `userdata.json` file. Make sure it's filled in like this:

```json
{
    "profile" : {
        "first_name": "John",
        "last_name": "Doe",
        "phone_num": "+1420690690",
        "catchall": "mycatchall.com",
        "passwd": "PA$$WORD",
        "address_first_line": "Washington Street",
        "house_number": "123",
        "address_second_line": "Apt 33",
        "zipcode": "10000",
        "city": "New York",
        "country_name": "United States",
        "us_state": "NY",
        "webhook_url" : "https://discordapp.com/api/webhooks/..." //can be left blank
    },
    "settings": {
        "jig_name": true,
        "jig_first_line": true,
        "jig_second_line": true,
        "jig_phone_number": true
    }
}
```

5. Script was working fine but now I just get `403` errors all the time?
     - Regenerate proxies (make sure you try both static and rotating)
     - if that doesn't help, contact me. Solebox most likely changed their security and an update will be needed.

## Where do I find generated accounts?

- If everything goes smoothly, accounts should be in the **accounts folder** in `solebox-valid.txt` as well as if you have a webhook setup, you'll get a Discord notification.
- if an error occurs when trying to update a shipping address, they'll be in the **accounts folder** `solebox-no-shipping.txt` and you'll need to update shipping address manually (or just gen new ones 😝)

## Notes

- If you don't have a catchall, feel free to leave the catchall field blank but you won't get confirmation emails (it will just create an account with a random gmail)

## FAQ

- What is `cd` and how do I use it?
  - From [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cd_(command)): "the `cd` command is a command-line shell command used to change the current working directory" -  so what you need to do is change your working directory, to the Folder (or directory) of this script.
- How do I install Python?
  - [This should help you](https://realpython.com/installing-python/)
- I am getting `[ERROR] -> Bad request. Satus code 403` or `[ERROR] -> Encountered CloudFare...` all the time, what do I do?
  - Keep trying and or switch proxies. This also happens frequently when the site is under a heavy load (When a restock/drop happens etc.)
